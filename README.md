# Dent

Dent was designed to have a fast mecanum drivetrain with ground clearance to traverse the scoring platforms with ease -- all while carrying a stack of totes. He has a main internal elevator that lifts totes up to six high within the robot, allowing us to move quickly to anywhere on the field without tipping. His intake system features a ramp leading to the floor with an active roller pulling the totes up to two collector wheels on either side of the robot, both pulling the totes in, and centering them simultaneously. But Dent doesnâ€™t stop there. A taller elevator on the back of the robot allows us to lift either recycle containers or totes to a greater height. With this, we can create stacks both internally and externally, with each system providing a backup of the other in the case of a breakage on the field.
